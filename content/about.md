# What is STACC?
### (Science Technology and Computing Club)

The STACC Club was founded in Fall 2020 by Tony Pham, then taken over by Caleb Hamilton in Fall 2021 to make it what it has become today. The hopes of this club was to start something for the Computer science, Computer Information Systems, and CyberSecurity Majors at RELLIS Campus in Bryan Texas to better connect our community. The goals of this club is to help the students involved to have a better understanding and exposure to different modern technologies to better prepare our members for their future, and since the technologies of the world on always changing, we hope to be constantly changing and evolving too!
